            <p style="color:white;">Ages ago, two races ruled over EARTH: HUMANS and MONSTERS.

            They lived peacefully for many years......

            But one day, the humans decided to start a war.

            The war was gruesome, but after many years the HUMANS had finally won.

            The MONSTERS decided to surrender, due to low resources.

            The humans had decided to imprison the monsters underground with a magical barrier.

            Many centuries later....

            MT. Ebbot 202X.

            Most humans advise people not to climb that mountain.

            But one day, a curious human decided to climb it.

            They wanted to find the missing humans.

            But little did they know that their curiosity would lead to their doom...
