            <p style="color:white;">In this new part of Undertale's world, take control of the new protagonist Louis (pronounced "Louie", as he is European) as he searches to learn the fate or whereabouts of someone he held dear. 
            Alongside this, cave-dweller twin humans "Sunny" and Renée will be joining Louis on this journey. Renée has a magenta soul called Leadership, which means that there are not just 7 soul types anymore, but instead, 
            there are many, many more, as to how could the vast diversity of simply being human be described solely in 7 colors? Lastly, Hui will join you, as well! 
            She'll teach Louis all the tricks she knows for getting around and help him travel with her technological genius and gadgets. She even says she once lived on the surface as Louis did! Hui has a brown soul called Innovation.
